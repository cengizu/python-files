Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 100000 and 1000000 generated incorrect results due to 0% winning chance of some countries

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Starting from 1000 simulations
